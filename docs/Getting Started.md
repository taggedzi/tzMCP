# Getting Started

So you want to capture media from a website? This is the place for you!. This tool will help you do that. It will require some setup and configuration, but it's worth it.

Setting up a proxy like this can be tricky, so we've put together several guides with the steps needed to get started.

1. [Install tzMCP](./PROJECT_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
2. [Install a portable browser](./PORTABLE_BROWSER_GUIDE.md)
3. [Connect your browser to tzMCP](./CONNECT_BROWSER_GUIDE.md)
4. Launch your browser through tzMCP (click "Launch Browser" in the **Browser Launch** tab)
5. Turn On the Proxy (click the "start" button in the **Proxy Settings** tab)
6. [Install the mitmproxy CA certificate](./CA_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
7. Surf the web.

There are a lot of options and settings to configure. Here is the guide for that: [Configuration Guide](./CONFIG_TAB_GUIDE.md)

Proxies are simple in concept but due to all of the options and moving parts it can be difficult I have tried to minimize the difficulty, and make it easy to use. However it is not perfect.  Many sites employ complicated or half/assed techeniques that can cause problems for the proxy. So this will not work on EVERY site.

Please understand and read the terms of this software before using it they are located [here](./CYA_NOTICE.md).
