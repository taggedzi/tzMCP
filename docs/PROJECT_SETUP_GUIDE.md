# ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up the tzMCP Project

Welcome! This guide will walk you through setting up the **tzMCP (Taggedz Media Capture Proxy)** on your computer for the first time.

This project lets you capture and filter media from websites using a proxy with a friendly GUI.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements

- **Python** 3.8 or higher (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Recommended: A virtual environment (for isolation)
- Internet access to install dependencies
- Optional: A portable web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

---

## üì¶ Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Download or Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tzmcp.git
cd tzmcp
```

Or download the ZIP from GitHub and extract it.

---

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

**Windows:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you're working from source and using `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

---

### 4. First Launch (GUI)

```bash
python -m tzMCP.gui
```

This opens the graphical interface with three tabs:
- **Proxy Control**: Start/stop the proxy
- **Browser Launch**: Add and launch portable browsers
- **Configuration**: Set MIME types, filters, logging, etc.

## üîê Setup the Certificate Authority (CA)

To allow your browser to trust `tzMCP`, you'll need to install a special certificate.  
Follow the guide here:  
üìÑ [CA_SETUP_GUIDE.md](./CA_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

---

## üßº Optional: Clean Up Old Files

tzMCP automatically cleans old log files and browser profiles. You can also do it manually using buttons in the Configuration tab.

---

## üß™ Want to Test or Hack On It?

- All the code lives under the `tzMCP/` folder
- Main entry point for the GUI: `tzMCP/gui.py`
- Config file: `config/media_proxy_config.yaml`
- Logging output: `logs/`
- Temporary browser profiles: `profiles/`

---

## üß† Troubleshooting

- If the GUI won‚Äôt launch, make sure `tkinter` is available
- If websites show security errors, install the mitmproxy CA
- Use the terminal output or the "Proxy Control" tab logs for debugging

---

## üöÄ That‚Äôs It!

You‚Äôre now ready to use tzMCP to capture and filter media from your browser sessions.

Feel free to explore and configure filters to suit your needs. Happy capturing!
